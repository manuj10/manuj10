Learn Money: A web application to teach personal finance (https://github.com/manuj10/LearnMoney : request access to see code)<!--  work -->
The goal of the project was to develop a solution that helps college students get the basic information about various money instruments they might use in their     current life and make sound decisions accordingly. The developed solution provides an interactive way to impart the knowledge through a web application as it       simulates the real-life tasks and results of actions.


Chest X-Ray disease diagnosis : (https://github.com/manuj10/CheXpert : request access to see code)<!--  work -->
Given the recent large availability of large, labeled datasets of disease diagnosis from chest radiographs, there have been various attempts at creating        automated diagnosis systems. We have used one such large dataset(CheXpert - Stanford ML group ref:https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/ ) in this project to carry out automatic detection of diseases from chest x-rays. We have used Big Data tech- pyspark and transfer learning and deep convolution neural   networks to achieve this.

We also submitted project results to Chexpert competition(https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/).
